# 100 Days of Coding Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of Coding Challenge** repository! This project is a personal commitment to improve my coding skills by solving a new problem or building a small project every day for 100 days.

## Project Structure

Each day has its own file, named in the format `dayXX_<description>.js`, where `XX` is the day number and `<description>` is a brief summary of the day's challenge.

   Implemented three methods to find the longest word in a given string using:
   - A `for` loop

2. **Day 02**: [Hashtag Generator](day02-#-tag-generator.js)
