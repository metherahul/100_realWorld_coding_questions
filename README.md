# 100 Days of Coding Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of Coding Challenge** repository! This project is a personal commitment to improve my coding skills by solving a new problem or building a small project every day for 100 days.

## Project Structure

Each day has its own file, named in the format `dayXX_<description>.js`, where `XX` is the day number and `<description>` is a brief summary of the day's challenge.

### Completed Challenges

1. **Day 01**: [Find the Longest Word in a String](day01_longest-word.js)  
   Implemented three methods to find the longest word in a given string using:
   - A `for` loop
   - The `sort` method
   - The `reduce` method

2. **Day 02**: [Hashtag Generator](day02-#-tag-generator.js)  
   Placeholder for a hashtag generator implementation.

## How to Run the Code
